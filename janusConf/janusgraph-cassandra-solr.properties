# JanusGraph configuration sample: Cassandra & Solr over sockets
#
# This file connects to Cassandra and Solr services running on
# localhost using the Thrift API and the Solr HTTP API, respectively.
# The Cassandra and Solr services must already be running before
# starting JanusGraph with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required. 
# It should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its
# standard storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift,
# cassandra, astyanax, embeddedcassandra, cql, hbase, inmemory) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager
# implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=cassandrathrift

# The hostname or comma-separated list of hostnames of storage backend
# servers.  This is only applicable to some storage backends, such as
# cassandra and hbase.

# Default:    127.0.0.1
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]
# Mutability: LOCAL

# Whether to enable JanusGraph's database-level cache, which is shared
# across all transactions. Enabling this option speeds up traversals by
# holding hot graph elements in memory, but also increases the likelihood
# of reading stale data.  Disabling it forces each transaction to
# independently fetch graph elements from storage before reading/writing
# them.
#
# Default:    false
# Data Type:  Boolean
# Mutability: MASKABLE
cache.db-cache = true

# How long, in milliseconds, database-level cache will keep entries after
# flushing them.  This option is only useful on distributed storage
# backends that are capable of acknowledging writes without necessarily
# making them immediately visible.
#
# Default:    50
# Data Type:  Integer
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in
# JanusGraph's storage backend.  After starting the database for the first
# time, this file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's
# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
cache.db-cache-clean-wait = 20

# Default expiration time, in milliseconds, for entries in the
# database-level cache. Entries are evicted when they reach this age even
# if the cache has room to spare. Set to 0 to disable expiration (cache
# entries live forever or until memory pressure triggers eviction when set
# to 0).

cache.db-cache-time = 180000

# Size of JanusGraph's database level cache.  Values between 0 and 1 are
# interpreted as a percentage of VM heap, while larger values are
# interpreted as an absolute size in bytes.

# Configure a Solr backend named "search" at localhost:8983
# and path prefix /solr/janusgraph.solr1.
# The collection must already exist -- see the manual for info.

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize JanusGraph's query
# functionality. This setting is optional.  JanusGraph can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends.  Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# index backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.
