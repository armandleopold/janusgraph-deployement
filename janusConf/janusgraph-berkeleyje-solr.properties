# JanusGraph configuration sample: BerkeleyDB JE & Solr over sockets
#
# This file opens a BDB JE instance in the directory
# /path/to/this/file/../db/berkeley and the Solr HTTP API, respectively.
# Solr services must already be running before starting JanusGraph with this file.

# The primary persistence provider used by JanusGraph.  This is required. 
# It should be set one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its
# standard storage backends (shorthands: berkeleyje, cassandrathrift,
# cassandra, astyanax, embeddedcassandra, cql, hbase, inmemory) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party StoreManager
# implementation.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.backend=berkeleyje

# Storage directory for those storage backends that require local storage.
#
# Default:    (no default value)
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: LOCAL
storage.directory=../db/berkeley

# Configure a Solr backend named "search" at localhost:8983
# and path prefix /solr/janusgraph.
# The collection must already exist -- see the manual for info.

# The indexing backend used to extend and optimize JanusGraph's query
# functionality. This setting is optional.  JanusGraph can use multiple
# heterogeneous index backends.  Hence, this option can appear more than
# once, so long as the user-defined name between "index" and "backend" is
# unique among appearances.Similar to the storage backend, this should be
# set to one of JanusGraph's built-in shorthand names for its standard
# index backends (shorthands: lucene, elasticsearch, es, solr) or to the
# full package and classname of a custom/third-party IndexProvider
# implementation.
#
# Default:    elasticsearch
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in
# JanusGraph's storage backend.  After starting the database for the first
# time, this file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's
# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
index.search.backend=solr

# The operation mode for Solr which is either via HTTP (`http`) or using
# SolrCloud (`cloud`)
#
# Default:    cloud
# Data Type:  String
# Mutability: GLOBAL_OFFLINE
#
# Settings with mutability GLOBAL_OFFLINE are centrally managed in
# JanusGraph's storage backend.  After starting the database for the first
# time, this file's copy of this setting is ignored.  Use JanusGraph's
# Management System to read or modify this value after bootstrapping.
index.search.solr.mode=http

# List of URLs to use to connect to Solr Servers (LBHttpSolrClient is
# used), don't add core or collection name to the URL.
#
# Default:    http://localhost:8983/solr
# Data Type:  class java.lang.String[]
# Mutability: MASKABLE
index.search.solr.http-urls=http://localhost:8983/solr
